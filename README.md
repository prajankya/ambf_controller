RBE501 course project: Team 10


## Install
(Development was done on Ubuntu 16.04, but as sourcecode is in python, it can run on any platform python is supported. Please report with bugs, so that we can add support to the same.)

If you do not have `virtualenv` already installed, you can install with the following command.

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Running

Everytime you want to run the project, run this command to activate/deactivate the `Virtual Environment`

```bash
. ./setup.bash
```
